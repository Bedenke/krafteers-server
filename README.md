## Running

To run the server: `java -jar krafteers.jar`

When running you should see your server listed on the **Join Game** section in the game's main menu, with a ðŸŒŽ icon.

## Configurations

Edit the `config.txt` file to configure the server as you want

```

difficulty [0..1] // 0 is easy, 1 is normal, 2 is double hard
frame-rate 16
max-players 64
log-level [off|info|verbose]
net stats [true|false]
```

Look at `/assets/data/maps` directory for the current `[Map Name]` options

Example 1: Team PvP (Survival map)

```
start Survival 9101
frame-rate 16
pvp true
max-players 64
title Capture the Flag [Team + PvP]
